* Helpful suggestions are listed under Palace Tips section

* Always read all your messages, fast-forward through them if you wish
* Some requests lack a target and must be investigated in the overworld to ID them

#### Confidant Rank Up Points
* You normally acquire enough points to unlock a confidant's next rank up event by giving positive responses to their prompts during conversations
* When you give a correct response you get 1 to 3 confidant points that are represented as blue musical notes that fly offscreen
* The sparkles that accompany the notes also show if you have enough points to rank up
    * If the sparkles remain over the confidant's head you do not have enough points
    * If the sparkles fly offscreen with the notes the next hangout will be a rank up event
* This guide notes the optimal answers along with their position, tentative translation, and expected confidant points

#### Omitted Confidant Answers
* All prompts where no response gives confidant points
* Ranks 1 and 10 which are always followed by a rank up event
* Fool, Magician, and Judgement which rank up automatically
* Moon which solely ranks up based on completing Mementos requests
* Sun which ranks up every meeting regardless of answers

#### Carrying Matching Arcana
* Carrying a persona of the same arcana while talking to a confidant gives an extra confidant point +1 for every response that normally gives confidant points

* You never need matching arcana for Fool, Magician, Strength, Moon, Sun, and Judgement confidants
